To be able to run the code, please open the folder in your chosen ide and make sure the dataset files are in the same directory as the python files. <br>
There are 3 python files: main.py, computations.py, and write_to_file.py  <br>
Please only run the main.py file for the penguins and abalone datasets. <br>
You should observe 3 outcomes after running the main.py file: <br>
- In your terminal console, you will get information about the datasets and you will also get warnings as the program runs. <br>
- Figures will be be popping up, these represent the visualization graphs for the base-dt and top-dt that are required, please close each figure so that the program can continue running. <br>
- You will also see the 3 text files (abalone.txt, penguins_he.txt, and penguins_le.txt) that contain the information required for steps 5 and 6. <br>
